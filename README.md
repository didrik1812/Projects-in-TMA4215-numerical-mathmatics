## Project 1
In this project newton's method for solving nonlinear equations was studied and we looked at newton fractals.

## Project 2

This project was about Bezier-curves. We studied first the bernstein-polynomials and derived de'casteljaus algorithm and used this to implement a function for 
creating bezier-curves. We was then able to use composite bezier curve for interpolating a dataset. Lastly we looked at an optimisation problem involving minimizing the distance
from the curve and some dataset, and keeping the curve smooth.
